# Pulse – Technical Report

---

## 1️⃣ Project Summary

**Concept:**
Pulse is an intelligent desktop-resident agent designed as a proactive entity capable of monitoring code, analyzing metrics, and learning from developer interactions. In the long term, Pulse will evolve into a cybersecurity guardian capable of detecting threats and vulnerabilities on the local machine.

**Objectives:**
- Reduce development errors and improve code quality.
- Provide proactive feedback and suggestions.
- Enable adaptive learning based on developer behavior.
- Build a scalable architecture toward cybersecurity and controlled autonomy.

**Target Users:**
- Individual developers seeking an intelligent, always-on assistant.
- Multi-language projects: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python.
- Secure local desktop usage, with potential expansion to multi-project management and cybersecurity features.

## 2️⃣ Core Features

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **File Watcher** | ✅ Done | Monitors project files in real time via chokidar. Exclusions driven by `pulse.config.json`. Debounced 1500ms. Filters on supported extensions (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.py`). |
| **Analyzer / Parser** | ✅ Done | TS/JS via ts-morph (AST). Python via regex fallback. Measures cyclomatic complexity, function size, nesting depth, and parameter count per function. Anonymous functions excluded from metrics (double-counting). |
| **Churn Metric** | ✅ Done | Single Git call per scan — builds a cache of commit counts per file (last 30 days). 1 call for all files instead of 1 per file. |
| **Coupling (Fan-in / Fan-out)** | ✅ Done | Static import graph built after each scan. Fan-in = number of files that import this file. Fan-out = number of files this file imports. Displayed in sidebar, not included in RiskScore. |
| **RiskScore Calculator** | ✅ Done | Weighted score per file (0–100) across 5 metrics: complexity 35%, depth 20%, function size 20%, churn 15%, parameters 10%. |
| **Database / Persistence** | ✅ Done | SQLite via better-sqlite3. Stores scan history, function-level metrics, and feedbacks. Scoped per project via `project_path`. Auto-cleans deleted files at startup. |
| **Score Trends** | ✅ Done | Displays score evolution (↑↓↔) compared to previous scan. |
| **Score History Graph** | ✅ Done | SVG inline chart showing score evolution over time (up to 30 points) per file. Displayed in sidebar. |
| **Feedback Loop V1** | ✅ Done | Stores `apply / ignore / explore` actions per file in SQLite. Buttons in sidebar. Feedback history passed to LLM context. |
| **LLM Module (V1.5)** | ✅ Done | Local AI analysis via Ollama (`qwen2.5-coder:7b`). Triggered by the `explore` action. Enriched context: source code, metrics, functions, import graph, score history, feedback history. Streamed response rendered as markdown in sidebar. |
| **Config File** | ✅ Done | `pulse.config.json` centralizes project path, alert thresholds, and ignore list. Sensible defaults if fields are missing. |
| **Electron UI** | ✅ Done | Desktop app with file list, risk scores, trends, feedbacks. Sidebar with two tabs (Métriques / Analyse), resizable by dragging (260px–700px). |
| **Multi-Project Support** | ✅ Done | Each scan scoped by `project_path`. Multiple projects coexist in the same DB without mixing. |
| **Function-Level Detail** | ✅ Done | Per-function metrics stored in DB and displayed in sidebar: name, start line, line count, cyclomatic complexity, parameter count, nesting depth. |
| **Auto-cleanup** | ✅ Done | At startup, Pulse removes from DB any file that no longer exists on disk. |
| **Shell Integration** | ✅ Done | Passive observation of existing terminals (VSCode, iTerm2, Terminal.app). zsh hook sends failed commands to Pulse via HTTP. Clipboard polling (600ms) detects error text. 30s correlation window links hook data with clipboard content. In-app banner with LLM analysis. Error history + recurrence detection in SQLite. |
| **Git Sandbox** | 📋 Planned V2 | Creates an isolated branch to apply and test modifications before final validation. |
| **Feedback Loop V2** | 📋 Planned V2 | Dynamic adjustment of RiskScore weights based on feedback patterns. |

**feedbacks**
- id, file_path, action (`apply` / `ignore` / `explore`), risk_score_at_time, created_at

**functions**
- id, file_path, name, start_line, line_count, cyclomatic_complexity, parameter_count, max_depth, project_path, scanned_at

**terminal_errors**
- id, command, exit_code, error_hash, error_text, cwd, project_path, llm_response, resolved (`0`=unknown / `1`=resolved / `-1`=ignored), created_at

### Planned Tables (V2+)
**alerts** — id, file_path, type, score, status, created_at
**proposals** — id, alert_id, diff_content, score_before, score_after, status, created_at

## 7️⃣ pulse.config.json

```json
{
    "projectPath": "/path/to/your/project",
    "socketPort": 7891,
    "thresholds": {
        "alert": 50,
        "warning": 20
    },
    "ignore": [
        "node_modules", ".git", "dist", "build", ".vite",
        "vendor", "__pycache__", "venv", ".venv", "coverage"
    ]
}
```

All fields have sensible defaults if omitted. `socketPort` defaults to `7891` with automatic fallback to `7892–7894` if occupied.

## 8️⃣ Main User Flows

### Flow 1: Startup Scan ✅
1. Pulse loads `pulse.config.json`
2. Database initialized — migrations applied automatically, deleted files cleaned
3. Scanner recursively reads all supported files (respecting ignore list)
4. Each file parsed → metrics computed (complexity, size, depth, params, churn)
5. Import graph built → fan-in / fan-out injected into results
6. All results saved to DB
7. UI displays ranked report with risk levels, trends, and last feedback

### Flow 2: Live Watching ✅
1. File modified → chokidar detects change (debounced 1500ms)
2. Analyzer computes AST metrics + churn
3. RiskScore calculated
4. UI updated in real time

### Flow 3: Feedback Loop V1 ✅
1. Developer selects action (`apply / ignore / explore`) from sidebar
2. Action stored in SQLite with score at time of feedback
3. UI report shows last feedback per file

### Flow 4: LLM Analysis ✅
1. Developer clicks **explore** in sidebar
2. Pulse reads the source file + collects enriched context (metrics, functions, importedBy, score history, feedback history)
3. Prompt sent to local Ollama instance (streaming)
4. Response streamed to **Analyse** tab in sidebar, rendered as markdown

### Flow 5: Terminal Error Detection ✅
1. A command fails in any terminal (VSCode, iTerm2, Terminal.app…)
2. zsh hook fires asynchronously → `POST localhost:{port}/command-error` (non-blocking, <300ms)
3. Developer copies the error text from the terminal
4. Pulse clipboard watcher detects error patterns in clipboard (600ms polling)
5. Correlation: if hook fired within the last 30s → command + exit code attached; otherwise `(commande inconnue)`
6. In-app banner appears: `⚠ npm run build a échoué (code 1) — 3ème occurrence`
7. **Analyser** → LLM streams a Cause / Solution / Prévention diagnosis enriched with top risky files from last scan
8. **Résolu ✓** or **Ignorer** → banner dismissed; resolution status stored in DB

### Flow 6: Git Sandbox 📋 (V2)
1. Proposal applied in Git sandbox branch
2. Human validation or automatic rollback

## 9️⃣ RiskScore Weights

| Metric | Weight | Safe threshold | Danger threshold |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Cyclomatic complexity | 35% | ≤ 3 | ≥ 10 |
| Nesting depth | 20% | ≤ 2 | ≥ 5 |
| Function size (lines) | 20% | ≤ 20 | ≥ 60 |
| Churn (commits/30d) | 15% | ≤ 5 | ≥ 20 |
| Parameter count | 10% | ≤ 3 | ≥ 7 |

Score ranges: 🟢 < 20 · 🟡 20–49 · 🔴 ≥ 50

**Notes:**
- Anonymous functions are excluded from all metric calculations (already counted within their parent function).
- Fan-in / fan-out are informational only — not included in the RiskScore.

---

## 🔟 Technical Constraints & Security

- **100% local execution** for privacy — no data leaves the machine
- LLM strictly local via Ollama — no cloud API calls
- Filesystem exclusions driven by config
- Limited permissions: no root access
- Scan history preserved across sessions — no data loss on restart
- Deleted files automatically removed from DB at startup
